<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

```sh
 gem install rails
```

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

```sh
  cd my-folder
  git clone https://github.com/banzaman/hellorails
```

### Install

Install this project with rails

To set up a Ruby on Rails (RoR) project, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Ruby: Make sure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can download it from the official Ruby website (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) or use a version manager like RVM (Ruby Version Manager) or rbenv to manage your Ruby installations.

2. Install Rails gem: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the Rails gem:

   ```
   gem install rails
   ```

   This will install the latest version of Rails on your system.

3. Create a new Rails application: Once Rails is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to create your new Rails project and run the following command:

   ```
   rails new project_name
   ```

   Replace "project_name" with the desired name for your project. This command will generate a new Rails application with the specified name in a directory named "project_name".

4. Navigate into the project directory: Move into the newly created project directory by running the following command:

   ```
   cd project_name
   ```

5. Set up the database: Rails uses a database to store data. By default, it uses SQLite, but you can configure it to use other databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL. Open the `config/database.yml` file in your project and update the database configuration according to your needs. Once the configuration is set, run the following command to create the database:

   ```
   rails db:create
   ```

   This command will create the necessary database for your project.

6. Start the Rails server: To run your Rails application, use the following command:

   ```
   rails server
   ```

   This will start the Rails development server, and you can access your application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
